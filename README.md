# portfolio
https://glennaellis94.github.io/portfolio/

used flexbox and media queries to develop a portfolio page.
Page includes a recent photo with my name and links to "about me", "work experience", and "contact info" sections.
page includes links to my run buddy application.
my most recent application is larger than my older applications, in this case copies of run buddy.
most areas resize correctly for smaller screens, issues with my application section. i assume its has to do with incorrectly defining the width of the image or flexbox in the new viewport
